#For this assignment, you are given an ADT and several implementations of that ADT in the form of class
files. You are also given an abstract JUnit super class with a few example JUnit tests. You are required
to implement the ADT and write JUnit tests to ensure that your implementation and the other
implementations work correctly.
For each data structure implementation class given to you that you wish to test, you must write a test
class. In this case, we will be giving you many implementations to test so that means many test classes
are required. However, the tests in each test class will be the same. This means that we can use
inheritance to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written and still ensure that all
implementations are tested with all tests.
