You will build a dependency graph from a list of given software packages and their dependencies. In the
graph created, each vertex represents a package. And, each edge represents a dependency between
two packages. For example, A depends on B is represented by a directed edge from B to A, indicating
that B must occur before A.
Once the graph class is created, you will implement and test the required utility functions. Write JUnit
test classes and a main method in PackageManager to ensure that your functions work.
Use the graph algorithms discussed in lecture to implement the required functions.
