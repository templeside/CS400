This is an individual programming assignment. Bring your personal computer to class to get started during
lecture the last week of classes. Complete before 10pm on Friday 5/3 (last day of classes).
Students are encouraged to complete this assignment from a remote connection to a CSL Linux
workstation. This is because you already have file space on the CS department's web site via your CS
account. Thus, you can view your web site on the World Wide Web (www) as you develop.
