#For this assignment, you are required to implement the BST (Binary Search Tree) class, the AVL
balanced search tree class, and a JUnit test class that shows that your implementations are complete
and correct.
The provided starter source files establish the inheritance hierarchy that we require for this assignment.
Students may modify the BSTNode class and create an AVLNode class in any way that you wish.
Do not add public fields, methods, constructors to other interface or class types.
